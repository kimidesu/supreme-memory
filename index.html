                    <strong>Confucius</strong> The name "Confucius" is a Latinization of the Mandarin Chinese title Kǒng Fūzǐ (孔夫子), meaning "Master Kong", and was coined in the late 16th century by the early Jesuit missionaries to China.
                    Confucius's family name (xìng: 姓) was 孔, mod.
                    Kǒng and his given name (míng:名) was 丘, mod. Qiū.
                    His "courtesy name", a capping (guan: 冠) given at his coming of age ceremony,
                    and by which he would have been known to all but his older family members,
                    was 仲尼, mod. Zhòngní, the "Zhòng" indicating that he was the second son in his family.
                    <br><br>
                    It is thought that Confucius was born on September 28, 551 BCE,[29][30] in Zou (鄒, in modern Shandong province).
                    The area was notionally controlled by the kings of Zhou but effectively independent under the local lords of Lu,
                    who ruled from the nearby city of Qufu. His father Kong He (or Shuliang He) was an elderly commandant of the local Lu garrison.
                    His ancestry traced back through the dukes of Song to the Shang dynasty which had preceded the Zhou.
                    Traditional accounts of Confucius's life relate that Kong He's grandfather had migrated the family from Song to Lu.

                <blockquote>
                    Zi Gong [a disciple] asked: "Is there any one word that could guide a person throughout life?"
                    The Master replied: "How about 'reciprocity'! Never impose on others what you would not choose for yourself."
                    Analects XV.24, tr. David Hinton
